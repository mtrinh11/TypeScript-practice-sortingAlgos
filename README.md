Learning to Use TypeScript by Making Sorting Algorithms

- Basics
    - Bubble Sort
        - Time Complexity: O(n^2)
        - Space Complexity: O(1)
        - Stable
    - Insertion Sort
        - Time Complexity: O(n^2)
        - Space Complexity: O(1)
        - Stable
- Distribution Sorts
    - Bucket Sort
        - Time Complexity: 
        - Space Complexity: 
    - Radix Sort
        - Time Complexity: 
        - Space Complexity: 
- Efficient Sorts
    - Merge Sort
        - Time Complexity: O(n log(n))
        - Space Complexity: O(n) 
        - Stable
    - Quick Sort
        - Time Complexity: avg O(n log(n)); worst O(n^2)
        - Space Complexity: (O log(n))
        - Unstable
